PlantUML: A Text-Based Diagraming Tool
PlantUML is a powerful and versatile open-source tool that allows you to create various types of diagrams using a simple text-based language. Instead of using complex graphical software, 
you can define your diagrams using plain text, making it efficient and collaborative.   

Key Features:
Supports a wide range of diagram types: UML diagrams (sequence, class, use case, activity, component, deployment), architecture diagrams, flowcharts, mind maps, and more.   

Easy-to-learn syntax: The text-based language is intuitive and straightforward.   

Integration with various tools: PlantUML can be integrated into your favorite text editors, IDEs, and documentation tools.   

Open-source: It's freely available and customizable.   

How it Works:
Write a text description: You define your diagram using PlantUML's syntax.   
Generate an image: PlantUML processes the text and creates an image of the diagram.   
Embed or export: You can embed the image in your documents, presentations, or share it independently.
