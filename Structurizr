Structurizr: A Tool for Software Architecture Visualization
Structurizr is a platform that helps software teams create, visualize, and communicate software architecture effectively.

 It's built around the C4 model (a popular approach to visualizing software architecture).   

Key Features:
Diagrams as Code: You define your architecture using code, making it versionable and easier to maintain.   
C4 Model Support: It fully supports the C4 model's levels of abstraction: System Context, Container, Component, and Code.   
Interactive Diagrams: Generated diagrams are interactive, allowing zooming, panning, and filtering.   
Collaboration: Teams can collaborate on architecture models and share them with stakeholders.
Integration: It integrates with other tools and technologies for a seamless workflow.

How it Works:
Define Architecture: You use a domain-specific language (DSL) to describe the components, containers, and relationships in your system.   
Generate Diagrams: Structurizr automatically creates various diagrams based on your model, including System Context, Container, Component, and Deployment diagrams.   
Visualize and Communicate: You can explore the diagrams interactively, share them with the team, and use them for communication with stakeholders.

Essentially, Structurizr helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders by providing a clear and understandable visual representation of the software architecture.
